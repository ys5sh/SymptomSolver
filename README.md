Project Name: Symptom Solver (AI Doctor)

Description:

This Streamlit application provides an AI-powered interface for analyzing medical images and suggesting potential health issues. It guides users through a four-step process:

Detailed Analysis: The system thoroughly examines uploaded images for any abnormal findings.
Findings Report: A structured report outlines observed anomalies or signs of disease.
Recommendations and Next Steps: Based on the analysis, the application suggests additional tests or treatments.
Treatment Suggestions: If applicable, potential treatment options are recommended.
Disclaimer:

The application emphasizes the importance of consulting with a doctor before making any health-related decisions. It also acknowledges limitations in analysis based on image quality.

Technology Stack:

Streamlit: A Python library for creating interactive web apps.
Google GenerativeAI (genai): A suite of tools for generating text, code, and other creative text formats using Google's large language models.
Markdown: A lightweight formatting language used for styling text in the application.
Installation:

Create a virtual environment (recommended).
Install required libraries:
Bash
pip install streamlit google-generativeai pathlib
Use code with caution.

(If you plan to use a custom API key for genai, place it in a separate api_key.py file and ensure it's excluded from version control.)
Usage:

Run the application: streamlit run app.py (replace app.py with your actual file name).
Upload a medical image (PNG, JPG, or JPEG format).
Click the "Generate the Analysis" button.
Output:

The application displays the generated analysis based on the uploaded image, incorporating the four sections mentioned earlier.

Additional Notes:

Consider adding sample input/output examples to the documentation.
Include instructions on how to customize the application (if applicable).
Provide licensing information for any third-party libraries used.
Example api_key.py (if using a custom API key):

Python
api_key = "YOUR_GENAI_API_KEY"
Use code with caution.

Explanation of Key Code Sections:

Imports: Necessary libraries for Streamlit, file handling, and the AI model are imported.

API Key Configuration (if applicable): The genai.configure function sets the API key for Google GenerativeAI.

System Prompt: This multiline string defines the prompt that will guide the AI model's analysis. It emphasizes the user's role as a medical practitioner and outlines the four response sections.

Model Creation: The GenerativeModel class from genai is used to configure the model parameters, including temperature, top_p, top_k, maximum output tokens, and response MIME type.

Page Configuration: Streamlit functions are used to set the page title, icon, and hide default elements for a cleaner interface.

Logo and Title: An image (logo.png) is displayed, followed by the main title ("Not feeling well? Snap a pic of your symptom & injury and we'll help.").

Description: A detailed description of the application and its functionalities is provided.

Sample Image: A sample image ("sample.jpg") is displayed to guide users on what type of image to upload.

Image Upload: A file uploader allows users to select a medical image in supported formats.

Image Display (Conditional): The uploaded image is displayed if a file is selected.

Generate Analysis Button: A button triggers the analysis process.

Analysis Generation (Conditional): When the button is clicked, the following steps occur:
The uploaded image data is retrieved.
An image part is created with the data and MIME type.
The prompt parts are combined: the image part and the system prompt.
The model.generate_content function generates the analysis text based on the prompt.
The generated analysis text is displayed using Streamlit's st.write function.
